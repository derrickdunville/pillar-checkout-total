```
$ cd scripts\windows
```

```
$ build
```

##### Test

```

##### Run

```
$ run
```

#### Ant

Ant can also be used to build, test, and run the program on Windows. From the project root directory the following ant commands can be used, and they do not necessarily need to be ran in order. The test and run commands will automatically perform the build step.
